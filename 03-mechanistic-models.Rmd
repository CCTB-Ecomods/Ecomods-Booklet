### MGM

MGM (Macrophyte Growth Model) is a process-based, eco-physiological
model simulating the growth of submerged macrophytes under different
environmental conditions. MGM is a simplified re-implementation of
Charisma 2.0 [@vannes2003] in Julia language. The model scheme is
depicted in \@ref(fig:MGM) .

```{r MGM, fig.cap="Model phylogeny of MGM (a) and simplified model scheme (b).", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("booklet_pictures/MGM.png")
```


Documentation and code is open access on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AnneLew/MGM).
