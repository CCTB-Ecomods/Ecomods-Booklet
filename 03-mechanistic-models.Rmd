# Process-based models

## EcoMods models

Here, you will find all of our working group's models. For specific
questions for each model, please refer to the respective lab member.

### GeMM

[GeMM](https://github.com/CCTB-Ecomods/gemm) (Genomically explicit Metabolic 
Model) is an individual based model that includes genomic processes. While first
used as a plant model later extensions for it were focused on genomic simulation
of *Zosterops*, a small passerine. The general organisation of the model can be
found in \@ref(fig:GeMM)

```{r GeMM, fig.cap="Biological organisation of GeMM objects (a) and simulation loop (b).", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("booklet_pictures/GeMM.png")
```
### MGM

MGM (Macrophyte Growth Model) is a process-based, eco-physiological
model simulating the growth of submerged macrophytes under different
environmental conditions. MGM is a simplified re-implementation of
Charisma 2.0 [@vannes2003] in Julia language. The model scheme is
depicted in \@ref(fig:MGM) .

```{r MGM, fig.cap="Model phylogeny of MGM (a) and simplified model scheme (b).", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("booklet_pictures/MGM.png")
```


Documentation and code is open access on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AnneLew/MGM).
