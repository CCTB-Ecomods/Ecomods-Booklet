# Hello and welcome to the EcoMods working group!

In this document, you will (hopefully) find everything you need for your
course/internship/thesis with us. The very first things you should do
before starting your work are:

-   subscribe to the CCTB and EcoMods [mailing
    lists](https://lists.uni-wuerzburg.de). Select CCTB and ecomod-cctb
    and register using your email address. These lists are used for
    announcements of talks or other important events.

-   get an account in the CCTB server. Our IT support, Patrick Haag
    (patrick.haag(at)uni-wuerzburg.de), can do this for you.

-   get access to the building. Your student ID card needs to be
    unlocked to be able to use it as a key for all doors. Patrick will
    also help you with this.

-   remind your supervisor to send you an invitation link for our
    [Mattermost](https://cctb-intern.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de). We use
    Mattermost for CCTB-wide communication. Be aware that the
    certificate for enabling https is self-signed. This means when you
    visit the Mattermost site for the first time, you will have to add
    it as an exception. Mattermost contains channels for different
    purposes like organizational stuff, lunch planning, working groups,
    etc. It is very similar to Slack, if you have used that before.
    There is also a [Desktop
    App](https://about.mattermost.com/download/#mattermostApps).

-   save these time slots for obligatory participation:

    -   weekly CCTB seminar, Wednesdays 11:00-12:00
    -   weekly EcoMods lab meeting, Thursdays 13:30-15:00

-   we also have a CCTB
    [Gathertown](https://gather.town/app/r4oLVM25VSqeXimY/CCTB) which is
    basically a virtual office space. It was used a lot during home
    office times, now, not as much anymore. But if you post on
    Mattermost that you would like to meet for a virtual coffee break,
    people will show up!

-   if you ever run into any IT-related problems that you cannot solve
    alone, post it in the Mattermost IT channel.

*Juliano*, do you have scripts for these points below that I could link?

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Usage 

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
